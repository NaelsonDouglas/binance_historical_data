his script collects and stores all the tickers from binance.com.

The ticker time is set to five minutes

All the data is stored in .csv on the folder dumps, each trading pair has it's own csv file

I created this script to gather data and use it in my future masters degree research in data analysis using temporal series.  But you can use it for wherever you please. 

The script is executing 24/7 on a dedicated server and automatically pushing the dumps periodically to Github. You can check the pushs timing on the commit messages, which are always timestamps
